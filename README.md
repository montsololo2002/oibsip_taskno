This is a repository for the projects I was doing for the Oasis Infobyte Internship. 

The first project is an EDA on retail customers dataset.  In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

The second project is a Customer Segmentation Analysis on a mall customers dataset.The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an ecommerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to
group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

The third projet is a Data Cleaning project on an AirBnB dataset. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job.
